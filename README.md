This rshell project consisted of the student creating their own shell.  In this project the student had to learn how to connect the commands using ";","||",and "&&" connectors.  The student also had to utilize the fork, execvp, and wait system calls. 

Some bugs that are in the program are if the user does not place the right number of arguments, if the user decides to use a different connector, and if the user puts a connector at the end of a line. These could all be bugs in the program.
